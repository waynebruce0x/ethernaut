I'll make a payable function with a selfdestruct(). Self Destruct is a 
robust way of jamming ether into an address

contract Pay {
    function ForcePay(address payable _address) public payable {
        selfdestruct(_address);
    }
}

But I actually couldnt figure out how to call this function and pay at the same time!
So I split it into a receive, and an address-taking.

contract Pay {
    receive() external payable {}
    function ForcePay(address payable _address) public {
        selfdestruct(_address);
    }
}
