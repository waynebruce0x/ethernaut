There's 'if' logic in the withdraw function that sends funds to 
the sender address. Following this, and outside of the block,
the sender's balance is updated.

Re-entrancy issues arise when the function is escaped at a bad
time (ie funds have been withdrawn but balances havent been 
updated yet!)

so we want to enter both if blocks, and somehow fall over inside
the inner if block (because its between transfer and accounting)
